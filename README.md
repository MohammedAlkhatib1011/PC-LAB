# PC-LAB
-	PC Assemble (Lab)
-	The recent lab session at the TIS class was an inspiring experience that significantly enhanced my understanding of computer hardware. The first phase of disassembling the PC was both challenging and intriguing. It required careful attention to detail and a systematic approach. Each component, from the motherboard to the power supply, had to be carefully removed and handled. Reassembling the PC was the next task. This task tested our memory and understanding of the function and placement of each component. It was a practical exercise in problem and critical thinking, as we had to recall the steps in reverse and ensure that each part was correctly and securely installed. Following the practical exercise, the quiz segment was an excellent way to measure our learning. It covered various aspects of PC components, such as identifying parts. The lab was useful in enhancing my confidence. Before this lab, the thought of opening up a PC and tinkering with its components seemed daunting. In terms of improvement, the only thing that could be improved is the pc we worked on; it is too old and harder than the new hardware to build.
